# Fluid-Model-for-DCQCN-ECN-PFC

A Fluid model based on Matlab to verify the impact of ECN/PFC parameters on DCQCN performance

I have made detailed comments in the source code. You can directly run Fluid_Model_for_DCQCN_ECN_PFC.m to verify the watermark impact under the given topology.

In addition, mainplot.m is used for drawing and is generally not used.

If you have any questions, please email me.
